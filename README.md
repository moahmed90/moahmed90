# 👋 Hi, I'm Mo Ahmed

💻 I work with Python and cloud tools to build practical, reliable systems.

☁️ Currently focused on cloud engineering, automation, and learning how production systems are deployed, monitored, and supported.

## 🛠️ Featured Project

### [Job Tracker](https://github.com/moahmed90/job-tracker)
A tool to keep track of job applications — available as both a **CLI** and a **web app**.  
- Built with Python, Typer, Rich, SQLAlchemy, Flask, and HTMX  
- Add, search, filter, update, and export applications
